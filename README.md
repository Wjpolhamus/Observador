**🌿 Observador: The game**
---
A peaceful exploration game about slowing down and appreciating the world around you.


**✨ Overview**
---
Observador is a meditative game designed to help the players reconnect with the beauty of the world. Whether you
wander through the many cities, look at the stars, or simply admire the landscapes. It might lead you to slow down
and look at things in a different light. There is no pressure in the game. Your duties are to experience.
the player can enjoy the beauty of the world around them.

And for the players who do enjoy progression, there will be missions and storylines to explore with many rewards.
But in its core, I hope it to be more than just an app or game. Maybe to spark some thoughts, or help you relax.

**🎯 Goals**

I believe the game industry is very saturated and it can be difficult to make something that actually does well.
Observador is intended to be my creative outlet. Its a way for me to learn and understand these things as a side
project. I will always be grateful I have these opportunities and time to create and work on projects like this.
Whether or not something comes out of it, does not really concern me. And maybe it won't even be a long game.
I go into this completely with the mindset of learning.

# Observador
Observador: The Game. A game where there is no urgency, the player can enjoy the beauty of the world around them
while not being forced to do anything. Or, if you enjoy having something to work towards, you can find missions
that reward you for completing, and progressing better. While there will be no need to follow the story, the option
will always be there, and youll be able to do cool things if you do! Someone who doesn't want to follow that
can just roam around and enjoy the art. The point though of the story is to express that sometimes we just need
to slow down in life, and enjoy what is around. The message is more than just a video game, but hopefully to spark
introspective thoughts into the mind of the player.
âš¡About
---
I have been inspired to create this game to learn more about the process, and become better at pixel art. I really
enjoy the idea of putting a deeper meaning to something through a story, and perfecting the artstyle and creating
a good player experience.

**Gameplay**
---
Within the game, the player can essentially explore wherever they want. I likely will not include features that 
create any urgency in the game. Maybe in the future there would be mods for it. The player can explore cities, 
complete missions, and gaze at the much beauty in the world and/or universe. It will have 2D and 3D sections, 
with dialogue from NPC's. It will include many items the player can discover, collect, and use in future missions.

**Goal**
---
With obviously the end goal of completing a game, I understand that it is a super saturated market. This is more of
a side project that would help me with my creative ambitions, and something I could use to create meaningful art and
stories. While usually to make a successful game you have to be really good and sometimes get lucky, I am more so 
creating this to learn. Who knows whether or not something comes of it, I will always be happy and grateful I am
able to create something; as many people in the world unfortunately do not have these priveleges. I do not want to
waste this, and use it for doing some type of good.

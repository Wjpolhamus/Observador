# Observador
Observador: The Game. A game where there is no urgency, the player can enjoy the beauty of the world around them
while not being forced to do anything. Or, if you enjoy having something to work towards, you can find missions
that reward you for completing, and progressing better. While there will be no need to follow the story, the option
will always be there, and youll be able to do cool things if you do! Someone who doesn't want to follow that
can just roam around and enjoy the art. The point though of the story is to express that sometimes we just need
to slow down in life, and enjoy what is around. The message is more than just a video game, but hopefully to spark
introspective thoughts into the mind of the player.
